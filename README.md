Orga.Zone Example 1
===================
With pure HTML5 and Javascript, there is a big area in the mobile market, where you do not
need to take the detour via the App Stores!

This first example demonstrates how HTML5 apps can be used on smartphones without the need for native apps.

![Example Screen with Add to Homepage](https://apps.orga.zone/up/5/5/screen.png)

It is solely using standard Javascript and HTML5 and simple interface libraries like

*   jquery-mobile
*   handlebars
*   jquery plugins

to give you a native feeling.

Manifest Usage
--------------------

The contained file "orga.appcache" is the according caching instruction that makes the
app run, even if you are offline.

It shows you, how to save key/value pairs on your phone, list and edit them later.
